            <h3>About Us</h3>
            <h2>Liam hennessy:</h2>
            <p>
              I started a roofing company in my family's name, Hennessy, when I
              was just 23 years old. After finishing school, I dove headfirst
              into the trade, working on roofs throughout London and my hometown
              of Dublin, Ireland. It was common for families in Dublin during
              the 1950s, 60s, and 70s to have their children working from a
              young age to make ends meet. My family was no exception; we earned
              just enough each week to feed and keep warm in our old tenement
              houses. With work scarce, my brother Tom and I often travelled
              back and forth to London, where I honed my skills in roof slating,
              tiling, and installing membrane felts and lead on chimneys and
              roof valleys. Today, our family business proudly bears the name D.
              Hennessy Roofing in both our Drumcondra and Clonskeagh offices.
              People often ask me what the "D" stands for, and I'm happy to say
              it's my eldest son, Darren, who showed a keen interest in my
              roofing tools from an early age. He's now a skilled roofer
              himself, carrying on the Hennessy name as a master craftsman in
              Dublin and throughout Ireland.
